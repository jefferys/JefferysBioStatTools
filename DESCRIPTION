Description: Statistical tools are scattered all over the place in R. I want
  one place to find them. I also want *my* documentation for them to go somewhere
  directly accessible, not hidden in text files. I expect most things here will
  be wrappers around existing functions. It does add overhead to
  pass big data, have to be careful about that.
