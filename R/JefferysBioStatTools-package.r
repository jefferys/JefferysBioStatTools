#' JefferysBioStatTools - Biostatistic tools organized for easy use
#'
#' Statistical tools are scattered all over the place in R. I want one place
#' to find them. I also want \emph{my} documentation for them to go somewhere
#' directly accessible, not hidden in text files. I expect most things here
#' will be wrappers around existing functions. It does add overhead to pass big
#' data, have to be careful about that.
