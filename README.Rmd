# JefferysBioStatTools - Biostatistic tools organized for easy use

Statistical tools are scattered all over the place in R. I want one place to find them. I also want *my* documentation for them to go somewhere directly accessible, not hidden in text files. I expect most things here will be wrappers around existing functions. It does add overhead to pass big data, have to be careful about that.
